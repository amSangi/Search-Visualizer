## About ##
A 2D maze-like graph search algorithm visualizer using Unity. Users can create mazes, set the specific search algorithm to visualize, set the heuristic if the algorithm is informed, and choose whether diagonal traversal should be enabled. This project served as a learning exercise to understand different path finding algorithms and hit detection using Unity's linecasts. I understand that it can be optimized by using alternatives to linecasts (e.g. using 2D arrays to store tile positions).
